# Repository Freeze — Source Repo Canonical

Status: ACTIVE

- The canonical system remains in `/Users/vwvd/Millway/AI-folder/Crew-AI`.
- This clean repo includes runnable runtime code and state.
- No cutover until an explicit migration plan is approved.

Rationale:
Stability, traceability, and preservation of context during MVP analysis.
