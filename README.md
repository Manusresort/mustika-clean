# Mustika Rasa (Clean Repo Skeleton)

This is a clean, scaffolding‑only repository for the Mustika Rasa system.
It reflects the target layout in `docs/IDEAL_REPO_LAYOUT.md` from the source
repo, but **does not** yet contain code or data.

Canonical source remains:
- `/Users/vwvd/Millway/AI-folder/Crew-AI`

Until cutover, this repo is documentation + layout only.

See:
- `docs/SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md`
- `docs/OPERATOR_ENTRYPOINT.md`
- `docs/REPO_FREEZE.md`
