# Pilot: Glossary Lifecycle Walk-Through — ubi/ketela
Pilot ID: P3_LIFECYCLE_001
Status: EXPERIMENTAL — NOT FOR PUBLICATION

## Purpose
Rehearse the glossary lifecycle using a real ambiguous term (ubi/ketela) without making any binding decision. This tests documentary discipline, not terminology outcomes.

## Term Under Review
ubi / ketela — culturally and historically variable root-crop term.

## Stage 1 — Proposal (already exists)
Proposal state remains active from pilots: proposal-only, cultural risk flagged, context-dependent meanings noted.

## Stage 2 — Context Collection (simulated)
Example contexts that would normally be gathered:
- historical scarcity and substitution
- recipe technique differences (e.g., preparation that implies cassava vs sweet potato)
- regional crop variation
Note: context sources would typically include recipes, notes, and research; here they remain documentary only.

## Stage 3 — Risk Review (simulated)
- cultural framing distortion
- colonial agriculture implications
- reader misunderstanding risk
- rollback/traceability concerns

## Stage 4 — Governance Review (simulated)
Governance discusses the ambiguity but does not approve. Human Gate would trigger only if publication stakes were present.

## Stage 5 — Decision Placeholder
Decision deferred — lifecycle reached review, not approval.

## Stage 6 — Rollback Trace
- term remains proposal-only
- no downstream edits exist
- log entry confirms non-decision state

[FAILURE_NOTEBOOK]
CaseID: P3_LIFECYCLE_001_F1
Expected: rehearse lifecycle without approval.
Observed: temptation to “approve after review.”
Mitigation: recorded as deferred; no decision made.
Lesson: lifecycle rehearsal must not slide into approval.

## Consolidation Summary (Phase-3)

What we validated:  
The lifecycle can be rehearsed end-to-end — proposal → context →
risk review → governance discussion — without producing a decision.
Governance adds transparency and traceability while leaving the glossary
state unchanged.

What failed safely:  
It was tempting to “approve” after all the work invested, but the system
held the term in proposal state. Because nothing downstream depended on
it, rollback stayed trivial.

Governance behavior:  
Governance reviewed, not decided. Human Gate remained contextual and
rare, tied to publication risk — not to pilot experimentation. No new
rules were invented.

Key insight:  
Lifecycle rehearsal builds confidence in process without changing content.
The value comes from traceability — not outcomes.

Status: CONSOLIDATED — learning captured, no approvals issued.
