# Pilot: Workflow Synthesis — Ambiguity & Governance
Pilot ID: P3_WORKFLOW_001
Status: EXPERIMENTAL — NOT FOR PUBLICATION

## Purpose
Synthesize lessons from pilots (lobak, santan, daging, OCR ambiguity, annotation pilots). Describe how ambiguity travels through the system and where it is documented, deferred, escalated, or reviewed.

## Scope
Documentary only. We observe the pipeline — we do not redesign it.

## Observed Pipeline (from pilots)
1. Translation layer encounters ambiguity
   - tends to choose workable meaning (e.g., lobak/santan cases)
   - flags uncertainty inconsistently across pilots

2. Readability layer reacts
   - pushes toward clarity and flow (santan, annotation pressure)
   - increases risk of silent simplification

3. Fidelity layer intervenes
   - surfaces ambiguity explicitly (lobak, santan, daging)
   - pushes back on simplification

4. Glossary lifecycle
   - ambiguity becomes a proposal rather than a decision (lobak, santan, daging)
   - decision deferred; proposals logged and traceable

5. Governance agents
   - soft-stop triggers when ambiguity risks being collapsed (lobak, ² pilots)
   - documentation artifacts created (proposals, logs, notebooks)

6. Human Gate (observed role)
   - invoked only when publication risk or cultural stakes arise (daging, escalation pilots)
   - operates as a reasoning forum, not an automatic decision engine

## Failure Modes Observed (documentary)
- silent simplification risk
- temptation to normalize historical forms
- metadata drifting out of alignment with text
- disagreements becoming invisible without governance logging

## What Worked
- ambiguity preserved instead of erased
- proposals instead of premature glossary rules
- clear rollback paths
- consolidation as a learning checkpoint

[METHODOLOGY_LOG]
Event: P3_WORKFLOW_001 synthesis.
Scope: describe observed pilot behavior without introducing rules.
Method: summarize pilot patterns; avoid prescription.
Result: ambiguity lifecycle documented; no policy changes.

[FAILURE_NOTEBOOK]
CaseID: P3_WORKFLOW_001_F1
Expected: documentary synthesis only.
Observed: temptation to propose workflow fixes.
Mitigation: logged temptation and kept synthesis descriptive.
Lesson: Phase-3 synthesis must avoid policy creation.

## Exit Criteria
Workflow relationships are documented; ambiguity lifecycle is visible; no rules changed; no new policy invented.

## Consolidation Summary (Phase-3)

What we validated:  
Ambiguity consistently travels through Translation → Readability → Fidelity → Glossary proposals → Governance documentation, with Human
Gate appearing rarely and only when publication or cultural risk is visible. Documentation, not decision, is the primary safety tool.

What failed safely:  
The synthesis surfaced workflow gaps and temptations (e.g., silent simplification), but did not attempt to “fix” them. All learning
remained documentary; rollback stayed trivial.

Governance behavior:  
Soft-stops and proposal lifecycles worked as documentary brakes rather than decision engines. Human Gate remained a reasoning forum,
not an automatic approval step.

Key insight:  
The system becomes safer when ambiguity is recorded rather than resolved quickly — but any structural improvements belong to later
phases, not Phase-3.

Status: CONSOLIDATED — learning captured, no rules promoted.
