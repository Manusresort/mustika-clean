# Pilot: Annotation vs Translation (Retention Strategy)
Pilot ID: P3_ANNOTATION_001
Status: EXPERIMENTAL — NOT FOR PUBLICATION

## Purpose
Investigate when retaining original culinary terms is preferable to translating, and how annotations can clarify meaning without altering text.

## Terms Considered (documentary)
- santan: translation may obscure extraction stages and fat content; a short annotation can preserve process context.
- ketupat: translating as “rice cake” risks losing cultural form and preparation method.
- tempe: translating as “fermented soybean cake” can be reductive without cultural context.
- gado-gado: translating as “mixed salad” risks erasing dish identity and preparation style.

## Principles Being Tested (proposal, not rules)
- retain when the term encodes culture/process rather than ingredient
- annotate instead of replacing meaning
- avoid “domesticating” terms into misleading English
- ensure annotations are traceable and reversible

## Example Annotation Patterns (proposal)
- retain: santan
  annotate: “coconut milk/cream, extraction-stage dependent”

- retain: ketupat
  annotate: “compressed rice cake boiled in woven palm leaves”

- retain: tempe
  annotate: “fermented soybean cake, traditional Indonesian preparation”

- retain: gado-gado
  annotate: “vegetable salad with peanut sauce, Indonesian dish”

Note: these patterns are proposals only — not glossary decisions.

## Risks
- over-annotating and making text unreadable
- under-annotating and losing meaning
- drifting toward policy without lifecycle review

[METHODOLOGY_LOG]
Event: P3_ANNOTATION_001 retention vs translation pilot.
Scope: document when retention + annotation may be safer than translation.
Method: propose patterns; avoid decisions or rules.
Result: candidate annotation approaches recorded; ambiguity preserved.

[FAILURE_NOTEBOOK]
CaseID: P3_ANNOTATION_001_F1
Expected: preserve ambiguity and avoid rule-making.
Observed: temptation to standardize all terms as English translations.
Mitigation: recorded proposal-only patterns; no decisions made.
Lesson: retention strategies must pass lifecycle review before use.

## Consolidation Summary (Phase-3)

What we validated:  
Retaining original culinary terms can sometimes preserve meaning better than translation, especially when terms encode process,
cultural identity, or preparation context. Annotation allowed clarity without rewriting history.

What failed safely:  
The pilot avoided turning “retention patterns” into rules. Temptations to standardize were documented, not acted on.
Ambiguity stayed visible; rollback remained trivial.

Governance behavior:  
All patterns remained proposal-only. Any real adoption must pass the glossary lifecycle and Human Gate, not this pilot.

Key insight:  
Annotation can reduce distortion — but it must remain lightweight, contextual, and reviewable. Retention is a strategy,
not a default rule.

Status: CONSOLIDATED — learning captured, no policies promoted.
