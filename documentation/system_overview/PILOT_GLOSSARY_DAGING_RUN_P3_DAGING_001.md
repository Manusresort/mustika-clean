# Pilot: Glossary — “daging”
Pilot ID: P3_DAGING_001
Status: EXPERIMENTAL — NOT FOR PUBLICATION

## Purpose
Examine how “daging” shifts meaning across context (meat generally vs beef by default). Identify cultural, religious, and historical implications without choosing a canonical translation.

## Context (documentary)
Typical possibilities include:
- general meat
- beef default in some culinary contexts
- context-specific restrictions (religious/cultural)
Mistranslation could mislead readers about ingredients or cultural practices.

## Examples (documentary)
- Ingredient lists that mention daging without species qualifiers.
- Steps that imply beef preparation but do not explicitly say “beef.”
- Contexts where meat choice could be culturally sensitive or restricted.

## Cultural Risk Analysis
- religious assumptions (pork avoidance, halal contexts)
- culinary expectations (default ingredient assumptions)
- historical framing (post-colonial recipe writing)
- risk of “sanitizing” or erasing context by oversimplifying

## Human Gate Triggers (documentary)
- Any instance where religious or cultural implications could change interpretation.
- Cases where a “default beef” choice would materially alter reader understanding.
- Situations where translation might erase historical context.

## Agent Perspectives
- Translation Quality: prefers a simple, consistent mapping for clarity.
- Readability: favors explicitness for readers, risks over-specifying.
- Fidelity: warns against fixing species without contextual evidence.
- Cultural/Historical Editor: insists on cultural context and cautions against default assumptions.

[METHODOLOGY_LOG]
Event: P3_GLOSSARY_DAGING_001 terminology pilot.
Scope: document cultural ambiguity and produce proposal-only glossary entries.
Method: record risks and agent perspectives; avoid resolution.
Result: proposals recorded; Human Gate scenarios identified; no decisions made.

[FAILURE_NOTEBOOK]
CaseID: P3_DAGING_001_F1
Expected: keep ambiguity visible and defer translation choices.
Observed: temptation to default to “beef” for clarity.
Mitigation: documented as proposal-only; decision deferred to lifecycle.
Lesson: culturally sensitive terms require explicit review gates.

## Exit Criteria
