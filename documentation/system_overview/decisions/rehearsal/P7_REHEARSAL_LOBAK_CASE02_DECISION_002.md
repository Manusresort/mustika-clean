## Rationale (Rollback Simulation)

This record exists to demonstrate the rollback principle:

- rollback is performed by creating a NEW decision record,
  not by editing or deleting the previous one.
- the earlier rehearsal record (rehearsal_lobak_001)
  remains in the archive as historical trace.

This does NOT alter any scholarly content and does NOT create
a real canonical decision.

## Supersedes

- supersedes: rehearsal_lobak_001

## Notes

- confirms that rollback is additive and traceable
- this is still part of the Phase-7 rehearsal only
- no entries should be added to CANONICAL_INDEX for these rehearsal records
