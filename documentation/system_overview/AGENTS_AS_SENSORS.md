# Agents as Sensors / Proposal Producers

## Purpose
This document clarifies the structural role of agents within the
capability-driven system: agents surface signals and articulate
non-canonical proposals, but do not make decisions.

This positioning applies across all capabilities and agent types.

---

## Sensor Role
As sensors, agents may:
- detect patterns, anomalies, or ambiguities,
- surface signals that warrant attention,
- highlight potential differences or risks.

Sensors do not interpret authority or intent.

---

## Proposal Producer Role
As proposal producers, agents may:
- articulate observations or hypotheses in structured form,
- populate proposal records with non-canonical content,
- express uncertainty and alternative readings.

Proposals do not imply correctness or acceptance.

---

## Structural Boundary
Agents do not:
- resolve ambiguity,
- select outcomes,
- authorize changes,
- close gates.

Any appearance of resolution must be explicitly human-authored.

---

## Rationale
By separating detection from decision, the system gains coverage
and consistency without eroding editorial authority or traceability.

---

## Non-Goals (Explicit)
- This document does not define agent behavior.
- This document does not assign tasks.
- This document does not grant authority.

## Example (Non-Canonical)

**This example is illustrative only. It has no canonical status.**

### Sensor Observation
An automated review detects that a preparation term appears
in multiple recipes with subtly different contextual usage.

### Proposal Production
The agent records a proposal noting the observed variation,
the locations where it occurs, and the possibility that
multiple interpretations may be historically valid.

The proposal explicitly avoids selecting a preferred
interpretation or recommending a change.

### Boundary Maintained
No decision is made. No text is altered.
The observation remains available for human review or
intentional deferral.
