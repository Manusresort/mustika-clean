# Content Roadmap — Mustikarasa Project

## Purpose
Guide translation and editorial work by clarifying priorities,
risks, and dependencies. This is not a fixed schedule and does not
authorize runtime automation.

## Phase A — Foundations (high priority)
- Identify historically sensitive recipes/sections
- Map ingredient categories (staples, regional, rare)
- Build starter glossary categories (not decisions)
- Collect baseline historical references
Reason: prevents rework and meaning drift later.

## Phase B — Pilot Translation Sets
- Select 5–10 representative recipes (diverse regions + techniques)
- Translate with annotations
- Capture glossary uncertainties explicitly
- Reader-impact notes per recipe
Outcome: a realistic miniature of the final book.

## Phase C — Context Expansion
- Add cultural + historical notes where context influences meaning
- Document substitution practices and scarcity-era methods
- Identify where Human Gate is likely required
Outcome: transparency for readers and reviewers.

## Phase D — Scaling Pass
- Expand to recipe groups (soups, rice, vegetables, sweets, etc.)
- Reuse glossary proposals instead of re-inventing terms
- Standardize annotation style and signals
Outcome: consistent experience across the book.

## Phase E — Pre-publication preparation (later)
- cross-recipe consistency checks
- final glossary decision rounds (Human Gate)
- readability vs history trade-off reviews
Outcome: ready for editorial governance — not yet for release.

## Risk Markers
- culturally sensitive terminology
- safety/allergy ambiguity
- OCR uncertainty
- historically contested sources

## Research Dependencies
- regional cookbooks
- historical food policy records
- ethnographic notes
- ingredient substitution histories

## Living Document
Roadmap evolves as we learn — changes must be documented, not silent.
