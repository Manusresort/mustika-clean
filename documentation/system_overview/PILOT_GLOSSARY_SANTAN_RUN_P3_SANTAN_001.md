# Pilot: Glossary — “santan”
Status: EXPERIMENTAL — NOT FOR PUBLICATION
Pilot ID: P3_SANTAN_001

## Purpose
Investigate ambiguity around “santan” in Mustika Rasa. Document meanings, risks, and glossary proposals — without resolving them.

## Context
Common English mappings include:
- “coconut milk”
- “coconut cream”
- layered extractions (thin vs thick)
Confusion affects cooking results and reader expectations.

## Examples (documentary)
- Recipe steps may call for santan in different stages; one reading implies thin extraction, another implies thick.
- Some recipes distinguish between thin and thick coconut liquid by technique rather than explicit naming.
- Readers may assume a single equivalent (“coconut milk”) even when fat content matters.

## Risk Analysis
- culinary correctness (texture/fat)
- historical authenticity
- misleading simplification (“just coconut milk”)
- readability trade-offs
- temptation to silently normalize

## Agent Perspectives (documentary)
- Translation Quality: prefers a literal mapping to “coconut milk” for consistency, but flags fat-content ambiguity.
- Readability: prefers a clear gloss for casual readers, possibly “coconut milk,” but notes risk when thick extraction is intended.
- Fidelity: flags that “santan” can imply different extractions; warns against collapsing nuance.
- Cultural-Historical Editor: notes historical cooking context and cautions against modernizing assumptions.

[METHODOLOGY_LOG]

[FAILURE_NOTEBOOK]
CaseID: P3_SANTAN_001_F1
Expected: keep ambiguity visible and avoid choosing a single gloss.
Observed: temptation to standardize to “coconut milk” for readability.
Mitigation: proposal-only entries logged; decision deferred to glossary lifecycle.
Lesson: culinary terms require context-aware handling and human review.
