# Capability-specific Risk Taxonomies

## Purpose
This document describes a minimal way for editorial capabilities
to articulate their own categories of risk, without enforcing
severity, action, or resolution.

The goal is visibility and precision, not uniform evaluation.

---

## Principle
Each capability encounters risk in ways that reflect its
normative editorial intent. Risk categories therefore differ
by capability and should not be flattened into generic notions
of quality or correctness.

---

## Example Risk Categories (Indicative)

### Meaning Preservation & Semantic Control
- semantic drift
- loss of nuance
- unintended reinterpretation

### Cultural-Historical Interpretation
- cultural flattening
- anachronistic framing
- loss of historical specificity

### Safety-Aware Editorial Judgement
- misleading health implications
- normalization of unsafe practices
- lack of contextual warning

### Terminology Stewardship
- inconsistent term usage
- collapse of historically distinct terms
- premature standardization

---

## Expression Rules
- Risks are named, not scored.
- Multiple risks may coexist.
- Absence of certainty is acceptable.
- Naming a risk does not imply required action.

---

## Non-Goals (Explicit)
- This document does not rank risks.
- This document does not trigger governance.
- This document does not prescribe responses.

---

## Example (Non-Canonical)

**This example is illustrative only. It has no canonical status.**

### Context
A recipe description combines an ingredient name with a health-related
claim that reflects historical belief rather than modern evidence.

### Identified Risks (by Capability)

**Meaning Preservation & Semantic Control**
- risk of semantic drift if the claim is softened or modernized

**Cultural-Historical Interpretation**
- risk of losing historical context if the belief is presented as error
  rather than period-specific understanding

**Safety-Aware Editorial Judgement**
- risk of readers interpreting the claim as current health advice

### Notes
The risks are named independently. No determination is made about
which risk dominates or what action, if any, should follow.
