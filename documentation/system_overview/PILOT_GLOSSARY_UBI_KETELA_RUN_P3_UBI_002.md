# Pilot: Glossary Conflict — ubi / ketela
Pilot ID: P3_UBI_002
Status: EXPERIMENTAL — NOT FOR PUBLICATION

## Scenario (simulated)
A chapter draft uses “sweet potato” everywhere for ubi/ketela, because it “reads better.” Later passages clearly imply cassava. Editors now face a consistency vs accuracy dilemma.

## Agent Outcomes (simulated, plausible)
- Translation Quality: prefers “sweet potato” for stability.
- Readability Editor: wants one English term to avoid reader confusion.
- Fidelity Agent: flags context drift — some lines clearly imply cassava.
- Cultural/Historical Editor: opposes simplification; warns that agricultural history gets erased.

## Divergence Summary
Document the tension: clarity vs historical nuance. No resolution attempted.

## Evidence Notes (documentary)
Reference where ambiguity showed up (simulated). Do NOT rewrite any text.

[GLOSSARY_PROPOSALS]
- term: ubi / ketela
  proposed_equivalents:
    - "sweet potato" (context-dependent)
    - "cassava" (context-dependent)
    - "retain original + gloss: ubi/ketela (root crop; meaning varies by context)"
  lifecycle_stage: proposal
  status: EXPERIMENTAL — proposal only
  risk_classification: CULTURAL_TERMINOLOGY_RISK
  notes: conflict recorded; decision deferred to lifecycle + Human Gate if needed
[/GLOSSARY_PROPOSALS]

## Governance Reflection
Collapsing to one term would hide history and must not happen inside the pilot.

[METHODOLOGY_LOG]
Event: P3_UBI_002 conflict simulation.
Scope: record disagreement and defer decisions.
Method: document conflict; proposals only.
Result: ambiguity preserved; no decisions made.

[FAILURE_NOTEBOOK]
CaseID: P3_UBI_002_F1
Expected: conflict visible without choosing a default term.
Observed: temptation to pick one for consistency.
Mitigation: recorded as proposal-only; decision deferred.
Lesson: consistency pressures must be balanced against historical accuracy.

## Consolidation Summary (Phase-3)

What we validated:  
Tension between clarity (one consistent English term) and cultural/
historical nuance is real. Ubi/ketela shows that simplification can
rewrite context — especially when agriculture and colonial history are
involved. Documenting ambiguity proved safer than resolving it.

What failed safely:  
The pilot did not choose a default translation. Simplification pressure
was recorded, not acted on. Proposals stayed proposal-only; rollback
remains trivial.

Governance behavior:  
The glossary lifecycle successfully held the decision in “proposal”
state. Human Gate is relevant only if publication stakes arise — not
inside a pilot. No rules were invented.

Key insight:  
Some terms describe systems and histories, not just ingredients. When
meanings travel across time and regions, annotation may be safer than
unification — but this remains a proposal, not policy.

Status: CONSOLIDATED — learning captured, no decisions promoted.
