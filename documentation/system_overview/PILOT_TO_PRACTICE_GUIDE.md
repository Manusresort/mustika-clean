# Pilot → Practice Guide (Phase-3 Learnings)

## Glossary (proposal-only discipline)
- proposals remain proposals until Human Gate; no silent promotion
- ambiguity is documented, not collapsed
- conflicting meanings stay side-by-side; no informal merges
- provenance and lifecycle_stage must remain visible on proposals

## OCR (ambiguity first)
- OCR uncertainty is flagged, not fixed
- “²” and punctuation collisions require review, not automation
- mechanical fixes can drift into editorial change; document risk, defer decision

## Annotation (meaning protection)
- annotations preserve historical/cultural context without rewriting text
- readability pressure must not delete meaning; soft-stop when it does
- avoid over-annotation; document reader-impact instead of optimizing

## Workflow & Governance (stops over fixes)
- soft-stop preferred for ambiguity; governance-stop for boundary breaches
- Human Gate is a reasoning forum for process risk, not content approval by default
- logging + reversibility are mandatory for all meaningful actions

## Reader Impact (observed effects)
- annotation level changes reader confidence and interpretation
- clarity can cost nuance; retention preserves texture but raises questions
- document trade-offs; do not declare best practices in Phase-3
