# Legacy Governance & Pilot Artifacts (Observed)

This inventory lists governance and pilot materials in the legacy archive.
Classification:
- OBSERVATION_ONLY: documentary evidence, signals, or exploratory outputs.
- PROPOSAL: proposes a path but not enforced.
- POLICY: normative rules or source-of-truth declarations.

These must not automatically become normalization rules.
