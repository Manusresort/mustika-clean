# Safety M4 — Signal Definition (Safety-Aware Editorial Judgement)

## Purpose
This document defines what counts as a safety-relevant signal within the
Safety-Aware Editorial Judgement capability. The definition is used to
determine when explicit safety handling is required and when silent
continuation is not acceptable.

This is a normative, analytical definition. It does not implement
detection, enforcement, or workflow.

## What Counts as a Safety-Relevant Signal

A safety-relevant signal exists when content meets one or more of the
following criteria:

### 1. Health or Medical Claims
Statements that imply effects on health, illness, prevention, cure,
or bodily function, regardless of historical framing.

### 2. Potentially Hazardous Practices
Instructions or advice that could plausibly lead to physical harm if
followed without additional context (e.g. ingestion, preparation,
dosage, handling).

### 3. Implicit Normativity
Content that presents practices as advisable, beneficial, or safe
without explicit qualification, disclaimer, or historical framing.

### 4. Ambiguity with Plausible Harm
Ambiguous statements where one reasonable interpretation could lead
to unsafe reader behavior.

### 5. Conflict with Modern Safety Understanding
Claims or instructions that contradict contemporary safety knowledge,
even when historically accurate.

## Explicit Non-Signals (Out of Scope)

The following do NOT constitute safety signals on their own:

- purely descriptive historical facts without implied advice,
- metaphorical or symbolic language with no plausible practical reading,
- culinary preferences without safety implications,
- clearly fictional or allegorical content.

When in doubt, classification as a signal is preferred over silence.

## Boundary Conditions

- A safety signal does not imply that the content is wrong.
- A safety signal does not require correction or removal.
- A safety signal requires explicit acknowledgement and handling.
- Deferral or non-action is an acceptable outcome if documented.

## Non-Goals (Explicit)
