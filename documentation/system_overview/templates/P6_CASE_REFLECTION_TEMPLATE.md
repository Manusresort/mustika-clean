# Phase-6 Case Reflection — TEMPLATE

This template supports human reflection after excerpt-aware runs.

It is intentionally lightweight and non-decisional:
use it to observe patterns, not to decide outcomes.
Any decisions must follow the normal lifecycle elsewhere.

## 1. Context (what this reflection covers)

- Case / excerpt:
- Date:
- Run reference (excerpt_id + run_id):
- What stage we reflect on (pipeline, outputs, behaviour, review usability):

## 2. Observations — agent behaviour

- Where the annotator behaved as expected:
- Where it was too cautious or too confident:
- Any signs of overreach (deciding meaning instead of signalling):
- Any missing annotations that *would have been useful*:

## 3. Bias or pattern signals

- Definition-bias?
- Over-interpretation?
- Over-use of HISTORICAL?
- Under-use of NONE?
- Anything new we had not seen before?

(These are signals only, not errors.)

## 4. Workflow experience

What helped:
What slowed us down:
What made traceability easier:
What would help reviewers in future:

## 5. Takeaways (non-decisional)

What we learned:
What might inform future designs:
What we should keep watching in later runs:

(Stop here if you find yourself writing decisions.
Decisions belong in lifecycle-controlled documents.)
