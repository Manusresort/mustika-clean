# Phase-4 Readiness Notes (Documentary)
Status: EXPERIMENTAL — NOT FOR PUBLICATION

## Purpose
Record the constraints and risks that Phase-4 must respect. This is NOT a go-ahead document and does NOT declare readiness.

## Non-Negotiable Constraints (must travel forward)
These are constraints from Phase-3 observations, not new rules:
- proposal-only glossary decisions
- reversibility and rollback first
- ambiguity documented, not collapsed
- governance stops precede fixes
- OCR restoration limited to mechanical recovery
- automation requires lifecycle review

## Risks If Forgotten
- “boring-work” shortcuts
- glossary proposals mistaken for approvals
- automation bypassing lifecycle
- annotation drifting into policy
- over-confidence replacing governance checks

## What Phase-4 Must Re-Validate
- reversibility still holds at scale
- glossary lifecycle remains respected
- governance logs don’t get skipped
- automation proposals stay proposal-only
- cultural terminology remains review-driven

[METHODOLOGY_LOG]
Event: P4_READINESS_NOTES_001 documentary notes.
Scope: capture constraints and risks without implying Phase-4 approval.
Method: compile Phase-3 constraints; avoid roadmap language.
Result: readiness notes recorded; no transition declared.

[FAILURE_NOTEBOOK]
CaseID: P4_READINESS_NOTES_001_F1
Expected: documentary notes only.
Observed: temptation to frame as a roadmap.
Mitigation: deferred; no approvals stated.
Lesson: readiness notes must stay non-prescriptive.
