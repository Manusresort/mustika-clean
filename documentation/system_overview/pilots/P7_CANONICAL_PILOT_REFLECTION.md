# Phase-7 Canonical Pilot — Reflection (LOBak lemma)

## 1) Scope

This pilot tested canonical decision trails on a safe case:
glossary lemma inclusion only (no meaning/translation).

## 2) What Worked

- Excerpt binding propagated correctly.
- Human-only canonical gate functioned.
- Artefact trail (run → record → index) was traceable.
- Rollback model remained intact (via supersedes).

## 3) What Did NOT Need Changing

- Decision-type lanes in P7_DECISION_TYPES remain appropriate.
- Glossary lemma decisions correctly stay HUMAN ONLY.
- No governance expansion required; existing guardrails were sufficient.

## 4) Known Limits / Notes

- Pilot covered only a single, low-risk glossary decision.
- Larger or text-critical scenarios should be tested later,
  but nothing in this pilot indicates structural problems.

## 5) Outcome

- No changes to decision types are required.
- Phase-7 canonical trail design is validated for glossary scenarios.
- Future work: run additional pilots in other decision types when relevant.
