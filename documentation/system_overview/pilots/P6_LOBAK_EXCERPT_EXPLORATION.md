## 1. Purpose

This document explores possible LOBAK excerpts for Case-02.

It is intentionally **non-binding**:

- no excerpt is selected here,
- no IDs are assigned,
- nothing is locked.

The goal is to reason about *what would make a good excerpt* before deciding.

---

## 2. Selection Criteria (Phase-6)

An excerpt becomes a good candidate when it:

- represents typical LOBAK content (not an outlier),
- contains at least one editorially interesting ambiguity,
- is small enough for crew iteration,
- has clear scan/OCR provenance,
- avoids sections where governance decisions are premature.

Rule:

> We prefer excerpts that create **editorial questions**, not translation pressure.

---

## 3. Candidate Zones (Non-Binding)

List a few zones in LOBAK that *might* be interesting, without quoting full text:

- early definitional passages (terminology, category framing),
- mid-chapter recipe context where variants appear,
- short segments discussing preservation or preparation.

Each candidate zone should include:

- why it might be useful,
- what kind of ambiguity it introduces,
- whether glossary pressure is likely.

No decision is made here.

---

## 4. Risks & Anti-Patterns

We avoid excerpts that:

- push toward premature glossary canonization,
- encourage translation-first thinking,
- are too trivial to exercise the workflow,
- require historical essays instead of annotations.

Add explicit reminder:

> Pilot-style improvisation is no longer acceptable — excerpt choice must be explainable.

---

## 5. Decision Process (Later)

When we are ready:

1. create a dedicated excerpt selection file under `docs/pilots/`,
2. document the final rationale,
3. assign:
   - excerpt_id
   - excerpt_source
   - excerpt_version,
4. ONLY THEN may Case-02 move to CANDIDATE.

Until then:

> Case-02 remains PENDING.

---

## 6. Out-of-Scope

This document does NOT:

- run any workflow,
- produce artefacts,
- modify LOBAK text,
- define glossary entries.

It exists to make future selection transparent and reviewable.
