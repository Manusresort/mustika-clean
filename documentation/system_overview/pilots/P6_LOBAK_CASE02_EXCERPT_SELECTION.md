# Case-02 — LOBAK Excerpt Selection (Governing Document)

Status: LOCKED  
Scope: Phase-6 excerpt-binding (documentary, non-enforcing)

## 1) Excerpt Metadata (Phase-6 binding)

excerpt_id: lobak_034_048  
excerpt_source: docs/pilots/P6_LOBAK_CASE02_EXCERPT_SELECTION.md  
excerpt_version: locked-2026-01-12  

These fields follow P6_EXCERPT_BINDING_SPEC.md.  
They do **not** authorize runs; they provide traceable binding only.

## 2) Excerpt Definition

LINES: 034–048 (LOBAK section)

Content type: cultivation / seasonal timing  
Expectation: contextual explanation, not glossary-heavy.

(Exact transcription lives in the source excerpt file for scholarly work.)

## 3) Rationale

- parallels SAYUR Case-01 (seasonal framing → comparable evidence)
- good annotation opportunities (context, historical practice)
- avoids glossary escalation as primary challenge
- helps observe bias (HISTORICAL vs informational framing)
- ideal to validate excerpt-aware runner + logging end-to-end

## 4) Known Risks / Watchpoints

- translation-expectation bias (do not “explain too much”)
- challenger might over-escalate minor ambiguities
- OCR artefacts must be logged, not silently corrected
- any mismatch between excerpt metadata and run artefacts = STOP & document

## 5) Lifecycle Notes

This excerpt is locked for Case-02.  
If a different excerpt is desired, create a NEW selection doc and mark this one
SUPERSEDED — do not silently edit the metadata.

End of document.
