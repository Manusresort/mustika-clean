# P6 Pilot Plan — SAYUR Mini Workflow (Pilot 02)

## 1. Scope & Excerpt Selection
- SAYUR excerpt with ~6–10 meaningful annotation targets
- Still sandbox-only; no publication pathway
- Criteria:
  - mixed labels likely (HISTORICAL, GLOSSARY, OCR, etc.)
  - at least one term that could trigger challenger WARNING
  - not primarily glossary-definition (reserve for later pilots)

## 2. Objectives
- Observe lifecycle distribution with multiple decisions
- Track whether escalation appears and remains selective
- Monitor challenger bias patterns under higher load
- Verify traceability when multiple items are present

## 3. Workflow (unchanged)
- annotator → challenger → crew_provisional → optional Human Gate
- outputs and JSON contracts identical to Pilot 01
- same evaluation template and logging requirements

## 4. Expected Artifacts
(same paths, new timestamped files under sandbox/workflows/p6_sayur_mini/)

## 5. Evaluation Focus
- % provisional vs % escalated
- reasons for escalation (if any)
- bias observations (documentary only)
- traceability completeness

## 6. Risks & Watchpoints
- over-escalation due to volume
- decision fatigue in crew synthesis
- empty-span artifacts affecting counts

## 7. Pilot Status (Pilot 02)
- Status: COMPLETED
- Notes: Pending excerpt selection and run scheduling.
- Outcome: Pilot 02 executed and evaluated using the locked excerpt (lines 52–66). Multiple annotator items and a GOVERNANCE/WARNING bias signal were observed; all decisions remained provisional and traceable.
