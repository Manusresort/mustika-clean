# Signal → Gate → Closure (Documentary Pattern)

## Purpose
This document describes a minimal pattern for making consequential
editorial situations visible without prescribing actions or authority.

The pattern applies across capabilities and supports traceability,
not decision-making.

---

## Signal
A **signal** is the recognition that something non-trivial has occurred.

Typical characteristics:
- ambiguity, risk, or uncertainty is detected
- potential impact exceeds routine handling
- silent continuation would obscure judgement

A signal does not imply a problem or required action.

---

## Gate
A **gate** marks the point where continuation without acknowledgement
would be inappropriate.

Typical characteristics:
- human judgement or explicit deferral is required
- the situation cannot be responsibly auto-resolved
- authority boundaries become relevant

A gate does not imply approval or rejection.

---

## Closure
A **closure** records how the signal was handled.

Possible forms include:
- accepted with rationale
- explicitly deferred
- rejected with explanation
- left open with documented uncertainty

Closure may be provisional and revisited.

---

## Non-Goals (Explicit)
- This pattern does not define workflow.
- This pattern does not assign responsibility.
- This pattern does not force resolution.
- Absence of closure is itself a signal.

## Example (Non-Canonical)

**This example is illustrative only. It has no canonical status.**

### Signal
During a review, a recipe instruction is found to combine
ingredients in a sequence that appears culturally specific and
potentially misinterpretable in a modern context.

### Gate
Rather than normalizing or rephrasing the instruction automatically,
the situation is acknowledged as requiring human judgement about
whether explanation or annotation is appropriate.

### Closure
The issue is documented as intentionally deferred.
No change is made to the text at this stage, and the uncertainty
is explicitly recorded for future review.
