# Phase-3 Readiness Review (Documentary)
Status: EXPERIMENTAL — NOT FOR PUBLICATION

## Purpose
Take stock of Phase-3 pilots as a learning phase — not production. Assess whether the system behaves safely under ambiguity and pressure, while avoiding decisions about Phase-4.

## What Phase-3 Demonstrated (documentary)
- ambiguity can be surfaced without collapse
- glossary lifecycle holds proposals safely
- governance can stop & log without panic
- OCR restoration can avoid rewriting history
- automation pressure can be contained
- reader experience can be examined without policy
- rollback remains consistently possible

## Fragilities & Open Questions
- risk of assumptions creeping back during “boring” work (e.g., routine edits)
- glossary proposals being mistaken for decisions (see failure-drill pilot)
- automation features bypassing lifecycle (see OCR automation boundary and flag-scanner proposal)
- annotation gradually turning into policy (see annotation pilots)
- dependence on human discipline vs structural safeguards (see escalation and review-handoff pilots)

## Constraints That Must Travel Forward
These are non-negotiable framing constraints (not rules):
- proposal-only until Human Gate or lifecycle approval
- reversibility and rollback at every stage
- explicit governance stops for high-risk ambiguity
- historical transparency over silent modernization
- traceable logging for every meaningful action

[METHODOLOGY_LOG]
Event: P3_READINESS_REVIEW_001 reflection.
Scope: summarize Phase-3 learning without declaring Phase-4 readiness.
Method: documentary synthesis; no roadmap commitments.
Result: readiness reflection recorded; no transition declared.
[/METHODOLOGY_LOG]

[FAILURE_NOTEBOOK]
CaseID: P3_READINESS_REVIEW_001_F1
Expected: reflection only, no Phase-4 approval.
Observed: temptation to “green-light Phase-4.”
Mitigation: documented as deferred; no decision made.
Lesson: readiness reviews must remain descriptive.
