# PHASE-2 Roadmap Retrospective — Repository View

## 1. What was planned
- Apply the autonomy model across editorial agents.
- Align CODEX_TODO.md with repo reality and document a chapter/batch workflow design.
- Document governance agent runtime integration and run a glossary/research pilot plus a governance test scenario.

## 2. What actually happened
- Session log entries show PHASE2_* items completed and documented.
- docs/CHAPTER_BATCH_WORKFLOW.md and docs/10-governance/GOVERNANCE_INTEGRATION_DESIGN.md were created.
- A glossary research pilot and a governance test scenario were documented.

## 3. What worked well (repo evidence)
- Autonomy model documentation was applied across prompts and AGENTS.md.
- Governance integration and batch workflow were captured as design docs.
- Pilot and test scenario outputs were logged as documentary artefacts.

## 4. Frictions / constraints observed
- No Phase-2 frictions or STOPs are explicitly recorded in CODEX_SESSION_LOG.md.

## 5. Governance & scope
- Phase-2 outputs were documentary; no runtime changes or canonical decisions are recorded.
- Governance triggers and lifecycle rules were reinforced through design docs and pilots.

## 6. Suggested follow-ups (repo-based)
- Continue with Phase-3 documentation reorganisation items and pilot proposals listed in docs/CODEX_TODO.md.
