# PHASE-3 Documentation Reorganisation Retrospective — Repository View

## 1. What was planned
- Plan documentation reorganisation per DOCS_INFORMATION_ARCHITECTURE.md.
- Run documentary pilots to test glossary and OCR governance workflows.
- Establish governed patterns for legacy imports and ambiguity handling.

## 2. What actually happened
- PHASE3_FRAMING.md was created and later stabilized as a baseline.
- Multiple P3 pilots were executed and logged (glossary, OCR restore, marker2 analysis, review-handoff, escalation).
- Governance documents were moved in a low-risk reorganisation pilot.
- A legacy OCR import and OCR ambiguity synthesis were documented.

## 3. What worked well (repo evidence)
- Pilots were logged with rollback notes and consolidation summaries.
- Governance framing and synthesis docs captured learnings without changing canonical text.
- The documentation reorg pilot was executed with rollback guidance.

## 4. Frictions / constraints observed
- A STOP was logged for marker2 analysis due to no sandbox excerpts found.
- Several pilot patches were required to adjust structure or metadata in pilot files.

## 5. Governance & scope
- Phase-3 work remained documentary and pilot-only; no canonical decisions were recorded.
- Guardrails emphasized no text edits and explicit rollback paths.

## 6. Suggested follow-ups (repo-based)
- Parked reorg items remain in docs/CODEX_TODO.md (PHASE3_DOCS_REORG_PLAN_APPROVED, MOVE_PILOTS, UPDATE_REFERENCES).
- Remaining Phase-3 proposal bullets in CODEX_TODO.md are still open or deferred.
