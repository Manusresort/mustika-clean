# Phase-4 Preparation Retrospective — Repository View

## 1. What was planned
- Define a governed sandbox harness and safety bridge for agent runs (documentary specs).
- Prepare sandbox readiness and governance templates for controlled runs.
- Execute limited shakedowns with rollback rehearsals.

## 2. What actually happened
- Readiness notes, sandbox governance templates, and runbooks were created and logged.
- GO/NO-GO forms, annotation stylecard, and sandbox checklists were documented.
- Sayur shakedown runs were executed (direct and crew), with logs and rollback rehearsal.

## 3. What worked well (from repo evidence)
- Sandbox readiness and governance artefacts were documented with rollback guidance.
- Shakedown outputs were recorded as JSON-only, annotation-only runs.
- Rollback rehearsal was documented and completed.

## 4. Frictions / constraints observed
- A soft-stop and run-closed entry exists for a simulated run due to glossary ambiguity.

## 5. Governance & scope
- Phase-4 work emphasized sandbox scope, manual gating, and no canonical decisions.
- Guardrails and incident playbooks were documented before live runs.

## 6. Suggested follow-ups (repo-based)
- PHASE4_AGENT_BRIDGE_DESIGN and PHASE4_AGENT_HARNESS_SPEC remain documented proposals in CODEX_TODO.md.
- Policy-track items (incident templates, diagramming) remain in CODEX_TODO.md.
