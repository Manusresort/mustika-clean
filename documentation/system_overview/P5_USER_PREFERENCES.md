Phase-5 User Preferences — Autonomy & Escalation

Status: documentary, informs Codex/meta behavior.

User context:

sole human-in-the-loop

does not speak Indonesian

wants agents and crews to operate with meaningful autonomy

Translation & Interpretation:

agents may propose translations

crews may confirm provisional translations

escalation to Human only when:
• safety / cultural-harm / legal risk
• publication-adjacent
• structural repo impact
• truly irreconcilable ambiguity

Preference:

minimize repetitive governance questions

Codex/meta should FIRST consult guardrails, lifecycle,
and preferences before asking the user

Principle:
Questions that establish general practice should become
documented defaults — not repeated session after session.
