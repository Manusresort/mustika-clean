Lifecycle state at review time:
READY_FOR_HUMAN_REVIEW (simulation handoff)

## Assessment
☑ Approve for promotion to next state  
☐ Send back for revision  
☐ Reject (document why)

Reasoning:

The annotator correctly treats the excerpt as read-only and limits itself
to signalling glossary-relevant terms. No translation, rewriting, or
hidden decisions are made. Reasons are generic but acceptable for Phase-6,
where the goal is signalling rather than editorial resolution.

This output should not be treated as authoritative semantics. It is
appropriate to move forward for human reflection rather than revision.

---

## Issues noticed
- Ambiguity: glossary meanings vary and will need real editorial work
- OCR concerns: none obvious
- Historical context uncertainty: expected and acceptable here
- Needs domain expert input: yes, in later phases

---

## Decision trail
Target state (if promoted):
READY_FOR_HUMAN_REVIEW

Justification:
Promotion records that the artefact is structurally valid, traceable,
and safe to present to human editors. No canonisation occurs.

NOTE: This review does not canonise anything. Canonical decisions happen elsewhere.
