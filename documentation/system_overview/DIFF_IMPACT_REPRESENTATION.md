# Capability-agnostic Diff & Impact Representation

## Purpose
This document describes a minimal, shared way to articulate
observed differences and their potential impact across editorial
capabilities, without prescribing evaluation or resolution.

---

## Difference
A **difference** is an observed deviation, tension, or alternative
between:
- source and translation,
- parallel interpretations,
- expected and observed structure.

A difference is descriptive, not evaluative.

---

## Location
Differences should indicate *where* they manifest:
- specific term or phrase
- sentence or instruction
- structural element (e.g. list, step, note)

Precision is preferred over exhaustiveness.

---

## Impact Dimensions
Potential impact may involve one or more dimensions:
- semantic / meaning
- cultural-historical
- safety or reader risk
- structural or interpretive coherence

Impact may be hypothetical or uncertain.

---

## Expression Rules
- Describe differences before judging them.
- Name impact without ranking severity.
- Allow multiple impact dimensions to coexist.
- Uncertainty is valid and should be stated.

---

## Non-Goals (Explicit)
- This document does not define diff algorithms.
- This document does not assess correctness.
- This document does not prescribe action.

---

## Example (Non-Canonical)

**This example is illustrative only. It has no canonical status.**

### Observed Difference
The preparation step uses a single term that could be interpreted
either as a general cooking action or as a culturally specific
technique.

### Location
Recipe instruction, second sentence.

### Potential Impact
- semantic / meaning: ambiguity in intended action
- cultural-historical: risk of flattening a culturally specific practice
- reader interpretation: modern readers may infer an incorrect method

### Notes
The difference is documented without determining whether clarification
or annotation is required.
