# Canonical Proposal Record (Documentary)

## Purpose
This document defines a minimal, human-readable structure for recording
non-canonical proposals, observations, or signals across capabilities.

It does not confer authority, enforce workflow, or imply acceptance.

---

## Proposal Header

- **Proposal ID:**  
- **Date:**  
- **Origin:** (human / agent / pilot / run-id)
- **Capability Context:**  
- **Status:** draft | under review | deferred | rejected | accepted (non-canonical)

---

## 1. Proposal Summary
A concise description of what is being proposed or observed.

---

## 2. Provenance & Context
Where this proposal originates from:
- source text / artefact
- run, session, or human review context
- relevant constraints or assumptions

---

## 3. Observed Difference or Issue
What appears to differ, conflict, or require attention.
No judgement or resolution.

---

## 4. Potential Impact
Which dimensions *might* be affected:
- semantic / meaning
- cultural-historical
- safety / health
- structural / reader interpretation

Uncertainty is allowed and expected.

---

## 5. Identified Risks or Ambiguities
Capability-specific concerns, without severity scoring
and without implying required action.

---

## 6. Notes
Open remarks, questions, or references.

---

## Non-Goals (Explicit)
- This record does not decide outcomes.
- This record does not trigger actions.
- This record does not replace human judgement.
- This record may remain unresolved indefinitely.

## Example (Non-Canonical)

**This example is illustrative only. It has no canonical status.**

### Proposal Header

- **Proposal ID:** EXAMPLE-001
- **Date:** 2026-01-09
- **Origin:** illustrative example
- **Capability Context:** Meaning Preservation & Semantic Control
- **Status:** draft

### 1. Proposal Summary
The term "lobak" appears to be translated inconsistently across
adjacent recipes and may refer to different botanical varieties.

### 2. Provenance & Context
Observed during a hypothetical review of two neighboring recipe
entries in the source text. No external sources consulted.

### 3. Observed Difference or Issue
In one instance, "lobak" appears to be treated as a generic radish,
while elsewhere it is framed as a specific local variety.

### 4. Potential Impact
- semantic / meaning
- cultural-historical
- reader interpretation

### 5. Identified Risks or Ambiguities
- risk of semantic flattening if treated uniformly
- risk of over-specificity if modern taxonomy is imposed

### 6. Notes
Further cultural-historical research may clarify usage, but no
decision is implied at this stage.
