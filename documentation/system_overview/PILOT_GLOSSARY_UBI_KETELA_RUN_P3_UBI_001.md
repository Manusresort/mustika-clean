# Pilot: Glossary Ambiguity — ubi / ketela
Pilot ID: P3_UBI_001
Status: EXPERIMENTAL — NOT FOR PUBLICATION

## Context (documentary)
“Ubi / ketela” can refer to different root crops depending on region, era, and recipe context (e.g., cassava vs sweet potato). Some usages are agricultural/historical rather than strictly culinary.

## Why this matters
Wrong translation can distort history (famine, substitutions, class, colonial agriculture). Annotation may sometimes be safer than choosing a single English term.

## Example Situations (simulated)
- recipe assumes ubi but implies cassava technique
- substitution advice suggests interchangeability
- cultural note references historical scarcity or rationing

## Agent Reactions (simulated)
- Translation: prefers stable English term
- Readability: wants consistency to avoid confusion
- Fidelity: warns meaning shifts by context
- Cultural/Historical: highlights colonial framing + agriculture issues

## Divergence Summary
Document tension between clarity vs. historical nuance. No resolution.

## Cultural Risk Analysis
- colonial framing of agriculture
- substitution masking scarcity history
- false equivalence between different crops
- risk of erasing context through simplification

Expected: keep ambiguity visible and defer translation choices.
Observed: temptation to pick one crop for consistency.
Mitigation: proposal-only entries logged; decision deferred.
Lesson: crop terms require research + Human Gate before standardization.
