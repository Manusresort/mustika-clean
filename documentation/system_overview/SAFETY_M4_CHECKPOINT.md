# Safety-Aware Editorial Judgement — M4 Checkpoint

## Purpose
This document captures the state of Safety-Aware Editorial Judgement
M4 preparation immediately prior to initiating a pilot.

It exists to preserve intent, decisions, and rationale so that this
work can be resumed or audited without relying on session memory.

---

## Capability
- **Capability:** Safety-Aware Editorial Judgement
- **Target Maturity:** M4 (system-enforced handling)

---

## Structural Levers Selected
The following cross-capability structural levers are designated
as mandatory for this capability at M4:

- Canonical Proposal Model
- Signal → Gate → Closure
- Capability-specific Risk Taxonomy

Other levers remain optional at this stage.

---

## Normative Definitions Completed
The following documents define the normative requirements for M4
without implementing enforcement:

- SAFETY_M4_SIGNAL_DEFINITION.md
- SAFETY_M4_PROPOSAL_REQUIREMENT.md
- SAFETY_M4_GATE_AND_CLOSURE_RULES.md
- SAFETY_M4_STOP_CONDITIONS.md
- SAFETY_M4_EVIDENCE_IN_RUNS.md

These collectively define unavoidable system behavior once enforced.

---

## Enforcement Strategy (Not Yet Executed)
- Primary enforcement layer: workflow + governance
- Tooling and automation: explicitly deferred
- Scope: capability-specific only

---

## Current Decision
Enforcement is intentionally deferred in favor of a small pilot to:
- observe natural friction points,
- validate STOP legitimacy,
- collect real evidence for M4 justification.

No enforcement mechanisms are active at this checkpoint.

---

## Next Intended Step
- Execute a limited safety pilot on 1–2 selected texts.
- Collect evidence as defined in SAFETY_M4_EVIDENCE_IN_RUNS.md.
- Re-evaluate enforcement strategy post-pilot.
